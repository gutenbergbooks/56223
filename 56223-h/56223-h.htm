<span class="smaller">BEING GLIMPSES AN REMINISENCES OF SCOTLAND
AND ITS PEOPLE.</span></h1>

<p class="center">By J. R. Grieve, M.D.</p>

<h2>INTRODUCTION.</h2>

<p>At the present time when every one is being urged to
bend every energy toward the conservation of food supplies,
it is surprising to me that so little has been written
in behalf of the extraordinary value of oatmeal as a diet
on which people can live and continue more healthy than
on any other cereal in the world.</p>

<p>I wish to present <b>facts</b>, not <b>theories</b>. I wish to tell of
what I know personally on this subject. I have not consulted
any of the laboratories of research or taken for
granted any data from the many-published statistics of individual
food sufficiency for sustaining life, but I have only
taken <b>facts</b> and invite my readers to form their own conclusions.</p>

<p>My father was a successful farmer in Perthshire, Scotland,
and employed quite a number of ploughmen. His men
were always big strapping fellows, weighing on an average
from one hundred and fifty to one hundred and seventy
pouds and as strong as oxen. None of those men ever saw
a two-bushel sack of grain because we never had such sacks.
What they were acquainted with and were accustomed to
handle were four-bushel sacks of wheat, weighing sixty-four
pounds per bushel, barley weighing fifty-six pounds
per bushel. These sacks they would carry on their back
and load on their carts and, after being hauled to the city,
would again shoulder them and carry them up two and
sometimes three flights of stairs in the warehouses. There
were few elevators in those days.</p>

<p>Now what had those men for breakfast that morning?
Certainly not beefsteak, ham and eggs, toast, or biscuits.
No, they had a large bowlful of bcrose. Each man takes his
large wooden bowl and puts into it three or four handfuls of
oatmeal, a big pinch of salt, then pours boiling water on it,
stirs it with the handle of his spoon, adds sweet milk, and
eats his breakfast. When the noon hour comes he goes
through the same process; and after the work is finished
for the day he generally has a bowl of oatmeal parridge.</p>

<p>The whole time occupied is probably ten minutes. Then
after smoking a pipe for ten minute more he is ready for
a day of strenuous work. Each man possesses a half-gallon
tin bucket, and that is filled at the dairy every morning
before breakfast with sweet milk, and that lasts him for
the day. No labor is too hard for those men. They can
stand any strain put before them and never complain of
being hungry. I never heard the least complaint of indigeston,
and the doctor would have starved to death if he
had depended on these ploughmen for patients. The allowance
of meal is seventy pounds every four weeks, and
that is all you require to give them. Often these men don’t
see a piece of meat in months and very seldom do they eat<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
wheat bread. Scotland has been called the “Land o’ Cakes”
from the fact that an excellent cake can be made of oatmeal.
The cakes are rolled thin and toasted before an open fire
until they are quite hard. I have eaten oatmeal cakes in
Virginia that were baked in Scotland, two or three months
previously and after being heated through they were as
crisp as if newly baked.</p>

<p>I grew up amid these surroundings and am familiar with
every detail. I had my porridge twice a day all through
my young life, and the development in my individual case
was quite satisfactory. I often tell people that I was
brought up on oatmeal and the New Testament, which is
true; and I can truthfully testify to the excellency of the
combination. Another important fact, especially at the
present time, is that we never though of adding sugar to
our oatmeal. Those ploughmen would have as soon thought
of sprinkling epsom salts on their porridge as sugar. To
this day nothing gives me such satisfaction at breakfast as
a bowl of oatmeal and milk. To eat a bountiful supply of
oatmeal and suppliment it with meat, eggs, etc., is a great
mistake. It is too nurtitious and impedes digestion. In
those days such terms as calorics, protein, carbohydrates
were never used and need never be used when speaking of
oatmeal. I ask one question: If oatmeal does tnot contain all
the elements of a perfect food, how did those ploughmen
stand up to their hard work and seldom complain of hunger
and more seldom need the services of the doctor? It
regulates the intestinal canal like clock work.</p>

<p>Sweet milk is absolutely necessary to complete the perfect
diet. Any substitute, whether molasses, butter, or
sugar, does harm. There should be a generous supply of
salt in making porridge and that does away with the craving
for sugar. I often meet people, doctors included, who
declare that porridge ought to be cooked for six or eight
hours. My only answer to that falacy is to point to my
brosemen. When Oats go to the mill they are put into a
kiln and subjected to considerable heat until the hull cracks
and they are three-fourths cooked, then they are sifted and
ground either coarse or fine as you wish. We had no
flaked oats in those days, and I cannot say whether the
smashing flat process is an injury or betterment to the
cereal; but I prefer the coarse-ground oats, as that was
what the men I refer to were fed. I am only stating facts,
as I have experienced them, and I stick to my original statement
that oatmeal used as the Scotish ploughmen use it is
satisfactory in every particular as to giving nourishment
and preserving health.</p>

<p>What a saving of time it makes for the housekeeker—just
about half an hour for breakfast and supper, few
dishes to wash, and no greasy plates to encounter. For
dinner you may omit the oats and take what you prefer.</p>

<p>In American hotels and boarding houses, also in private
homes, oatmeal is served in small quantities in small
saucers as a side dish. It ought to be the <b>main and only</b>
dish both morning and evening.</p>

<p>Oatmeal has a wonderfully beneficial effect on the morality
of men. You might spend an evening, as I have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
many times done, in those men’s quarters, and you would
not hear a profane word or an objectionable sentence from
the lips of any one of them. Those men nearly all go to
Church on Sunday as regularly as they go to work on Monday.
They are intelligent as a rule and demonstrate by
their conversation that their diet has nourished the gray
matter as well as their muscles.</p>

<p>If oatmeal acted so beneficial fifty years ago on the inhabitants
of Scotland, it surely is a good argument that it
will perform its duty on Americans just as well to-day.</p>

<p>Personally it would be immaterial to me if the wheat
and sugar crops failed entirely, so long as I could have the
dear old cereal that nourished me to manhood and the good
will of a fine Jersey.</p>

<p>While oatmeal sustains the body and keeps it in fine
condition, it certainly must exercise a powerful influence
upon the brain. Sir Walter Scott was an oatmeal man. In
intellect he was “one of them.” Sir David Brewster, the
Royal Astranomer, who could scan with more than eagle’s
eye the mighty creations in the bosom of space, was made
mostly of oatmeal. Hugh Miller, that huge geological hammer,
inscribed with Hebrew characters, was an oatmeal man.
So was “Bobby” Burns, and the man does not live who can
say that “Bobby” had no brains.</p>

<p>No argument can be brought to bear against oatmeal.
If you believe what I say is true, why not put it to the
test. I know it is a great problem to change the dietitic
habits of a community—and much more so to change the
habits of a nation. There are Scotchmen scattered everywhere,
and no doubt they and their wives would supervise
Oatmeal Clubs to teach the people how to make porridge
properly and to overcome any prejudice they might have
as to its use. No doubt it is an acquired taste, but when
once learned it is for “keeps.”</p>

<p>When I first came to America I did not eat any tomatoes
for years. I could not endure the taste, but gradually I
took to them, and now I dearly enjoy them.</p>

<p>Many of my friends, through solicitation and my example,
have adopted the oatmeal habit, and all of them are delighted
with the result and intend to make it permanent.</p>

<p>Just imagine what conversation of food it would be if a
vast multitude enlisted under the oatmeal banner. Meatless,
wheatless, and surgarless days at least six days in the
week for breakfast and supper. For dinner and on Sundays
I should allow every one who wished to indulge in the
fruit of the hen and the ham of the hog, or whatever delicacy
might suit their individual taste.</p>

<p>The Duke of Wellington knew his business when he held
in reserve the famous Scot’s Grey cavalry at the battle of
Waterloo, until the psycological moment arrived when the
French lines began to waver, then ordered the charge
which sent them thundering on striking the enemy like an
avalanch and thereby winning the battle. So in a modest
way I think the psycological moment has arrived when the
people of America will listen to what I say and began to
cultivate the taste for oatmeal and use it liberally, thereby<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
conserving food for the great emergency now and which
will be more acute by and by.</p>

<p>It was oatmeal personified in the kilted Highlanders that
scaled the heights of Alma and later stormed the Russian
stronghold, Sebastopol. Oatmeal rode in the light brigade
at Baladava, “charging an army while all the world wonder.”
Oatmeal sang Annie Laurie thirty thousand strong in the
Crimean trenches in front of Sebastopol on the eve of the
grand assault.</p>

<p>When Dr. Samuel Johnson, the lexicographer, vented his
unaccountable spleen against the Scotch people by defining
“oatmeal” as “food for English horses and Scottish men,”
he exposed himself to the witty retort. “And where will
you find finer horses or better men.” Thomas Carlyle tells
us that on one occasion, during a visit he paid to Lord Ashburton,
at the Grange, he caught sight of Macauley’s face
in unwonted repose, as he was turning over the pages of
a book. “I noticed,” said he, “the homely Norse features,
that you find everywhere in the Western Isles, and I thought
to myself; well, any one can see that you are an honest
good sort of a fellow, made out of oatmeal.”</p>

<p>To what extent the characteristic peculiarities of nations
are due to diet is a question on which we will not enter. We
believe, however, that the matter of food has much to do
in determining the character and destiny of a people; and
oatmeal being the principal food of Scotland it would seem
to be certain that the people who have been made out of
it, have been in themselves very remarkable: and have exercised
an influence upon the whole civilized world that is
unique and singularly potential.</p>

<p>In introducing our subject, it would seem to be proper to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
say a few words about the “land o’ cakes”—that is, oat
cakes. First, there is no word in any language that has in
it such perfect music, or around which cling dearer and
sweeter associations than the word “Caledonia.”</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“Oh Caledonia stern and wild,</div>
<div class="verse">Meet nurse for a poetic child.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Under the spell of that name imagination takes wing, and
we are back in the springtime of youth. We hear the lark
singing in the clear air. We smell the fragrance of the
heather. We hear the plow-boy’s whistle, and the mild-maid’s
song,—some lively ditty to relieve the tedium of
labor, or it may be an old heroic melody, that glimpses
some grand page of Scottish story. We hear again the
murmur of voices that for long years have sunk into silence.
Faces rise before us that had begun to fade from
our recollection, scenes in which we formed a part, pass as
a panorama, and remain for ever on the deathless page of
memory.</p>

<p>To the student of history, Scotland is not a foreign country.
The genius of its sons has made it familiar and home
like to every lover of pure literature, true patriotism and
heroic virtue. In undertaking to speak of it, we are embarassed
with our riches.</p>

<p>We are not so perplexed about what we shall say, as how
to say it within reasonable limits. These however are but
glimpses and glances of Scotland and its people, and may
serve to inspire some to seek a fuller and clearer vision, and
larger grasp of a theme that can never grow old while men
struggle to conquer hostile forces, or strive to win a place
in the van of civilization.</p>

<p>Scotland is the land of old romance; where ever the eye
turns some scene of classic and storied interest presents itself.
There, near Stirling stands that grand modern monument
to William Wallace—the hero of Scotland,—the wielder
of “Freedom’s sword.” A mile distant is the scene of
the battle of Bannockburn where Robert Bruce achieved
the deliverance of the Scottish people from the despotism
of Edward 1st, and established their independence as a nation.</p>

<p>It is the land where mountain torrents rave down the
glens, or tumble from the steep torn into foam; or that murmur
softly as they steal along on the level plain under the
hazel and the broom, a land whose ruggid coast lines are
indented by immense fissures through which the ocean
pours its tidal waves to expand into lakes in the interior—lakes
which mirror the giant forms of the mountains, and
higher up where lonely tarns sleep, and the nests of the
sea gull and the eagle remain undisturbed in their solitude.
It is a land where magic cloud scenes unfold their sudden
splendors in fiery crimson and gold, or whose skies darken
in fierce tempests that blot out mountain and plain in a moment
in the whirling gusts and eddies of wind and rain.
A land, in brief, which has many vicissitudes of climate,
from the wild winter storms to the soft and gentle touches
of spring—the fervid heats of summer melting into the
glowing radiance of autumn sunsets unrivalled for beauty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
of coloring. One stroke of Scott’s magic pen pictures it
thus:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“The Western waves of ebbing day</div>
<div class="verse indent1">Rolled o’er the glen their level way;</div>
<div class="verse">Each purple peak, each flinty spire</div>
<div class="verse indent1">Was bathed in floods of living fire.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The capital city of Scotland is Edinburgh. It is a city of
marvelous contrasts in the style of its architecture. It is
divided into the old and the new towns. But the first of
these arrests the attention, chiefly from the quaint and
curious combinations in structure which its buildings present.
They are built of stone, and many of them rise ten
and twelve stories, their entrances carved with figures grotesque
and repulsive—griffins, dragons, monsters—half
beast and half man, with hideous scowls and leers glare and
grin upon you as if daring you to enter. On one of the
lower streets is the “Grass Market” which was the principal
place for public evecutions, and where so many of the
martyrs of the Scottish covenant sealed their testimony to
the truth of God’s word with their blood. This spot recalls
many of the dark deeds of an age which placed an interdict
upon the human mind, attempted to rule conscience by the
strong arm of law, and crush human liberty under the iron
heel of remorseless and ferocious oppression. Here is Holyrood
palace, an ancient pile with its quadrangles, courts,
turrets, winding stone stairs, and long resounding corridors.
Here is the secret stair upon which, on that memorable night
in Scottish history, crept Ruthren, Douglass, and their co-conspirators,
who bursting into the Queen’s private apartment,
seized Rizzio, the Italian singer, and in spite of his
cries for mercy, and the intercession of his royal mistress,
dragged him out upon the landing, and stabbed him to death
with their daggers. The stain of his blood is shown on
the oaken floor to this day.</p>

<p>A little way up the Cannon gate stands the house of
John Knox, that man of iron resolution and overpowering
eloquence, who alone dared to face the treacherous and unhappy
Queen and wring from her eyes the tears of vain
but exasperated importunity. This is he who prayed in the
over pouring interest of his soul, “Lord, give me Scotland
else I die,” and whose epitaph was, “Here lies one who never
feared the face of man.”</p>

<p>Edinburg has many monuments to its Kings, Princes, and
great warriars, but the monument to John Knox is not of
brass or marble, but a more enduring memorial built in the
deathless admiration and affection of the Scottish people.
He was a man for the age in which he lived. Much however,
which he did and said can not be approved in the
clearer light and under the calmer judgment of this century,
and by the unimpassioned standard of a juster apprehension
of God’s scheme of human salvation. Still he
was one of the greatest minds Scotland has produced, and
his name is enrolled among the immortals.</p>

<p>A little to the Southeast of Edinburgh rises a lofty hill,
called “Arthur’s seat.” It presents a curious phenomnon
in the outlines of its summit. Looking at it from the eastern
side in the purple glow of sunset, there is clearly defined<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
in beautiful but colossal proportions the form of a
couchant lion, one part of the summit to the left forming
the hips, the other elevation the neck and head, the undulation
between showing the soft outlines and symmetrical
bend of the body. The head seems to rest on the outstretched
paws and slightly turned, looks as if watching the city
with sleepless vigilance. In one of the most conspicuous
points of Princes street stands that splendid triumph of
architectural genius dedicated to the brightest mind in literature
which Scotland claims.</p>

<p>A man dear to every lover of ancient song and story—one
who has robed the mountains, valleys and streams of
Scotland with immortal glory and universal renoun—Sir
Walter Scott. We have spent many a pleasant hour studying
the rugged and homely face of that figue which sits
in the Centre with the Scottish plait thrown over his sholder
and his favorite and famous stag-hound crouching at
his feet. He has given to Scotland a citizenship of literature.
Scenery, monuments, houses, cottages, characters of
every age and condition from the baron to the fisherman,
from the lady to the smuggler and fish wife.</p>

<p>The witchery of the man’s genius has cast its spell over
every Englid-speaking nation. In every society that cultivates
the graces and refinements of polite literature, no author
holds a place of higher distinction than Walter Scott.</p>

<p>His works are classics. With the exception of Shakespeare,
no author has “held the mirror up to nature” and
pictured it with such graphic nicety of detail and gracefulness
of flowing outlines as this “wizard of the north.” He
opens wide the doors of romance and invites us to partake
with him in the rich and abundant banquet of song and
story which a thousand years of history have been preparing,
and which he has with prodigious labor and unwearied
industry collected with his own hand and brain and
disposed on the ample board with such graceful profusion.
The guests he invites us to meet are for the most part real
men and women—heroes whose deeds of powess eclipse in
daring and self-sacrifice the classic warriors who wandered
with Aeneas, and battled around the walls of ancient Troy.
The martial ardor of Wallace and Rob Roy is kindled in
our breasts, we catch the glow of a holy and patriatic inspiration
as we stand with the heroes of the Scottish covenant
at Drumclog, and see them after psalm and prayer in
fierce conflict with the Royal forces under Claverhouse, and
putting them to flight after one of the bloodiest battles, for
the number engaged recorded in history.</p>

<p>Then we bewail the woeful fanaticism that turned their
camp into a school of wrangling polemics, thus forestalling
their ignommious and irretrievable disaster at Bothwell
Bride—a defeat which Clavenhouse swore would redeem his
disgrace in a tenfold measure at Drumclog. Or again we
are transported into some sylvan retreat, and trip lightly
among the sweet mountain harebells in the west with “The
Lady of the Lake.” We watch the hunt as it dashes through
the perilous defiles where the rocks in the mountain gorge
seem</p>

<p>Or the blood tingles and the eye dilates with tremulous uncertainty
as to the issue of the combat between Fitz James
and Roderich Dhu. There is the subtle and agile Saxon
loot to foot with the larger, but not less heroic gael; and
when the latter goes down blinded with blood and fury,
and falls fainting on the sod leaving his antagonist breathless
but unscathed, we confess our sympathy is largely with
the brave but unfortunate highlander, and feel sorry that
he did not succeed in giving the gay and lordly Fitz a refreshing
diff with his dagger before he fainted and fell.
Then the scene changes and we are with Marmion where
“Day, sets on Normans castled steep, and Cheviot’s mountains
lone,” we follow the gloomy spirit through its conflicts,
its sorrows and its crimes, and watch the last tragic
scene of his eventful history.</p>

<p>The battle is raging over the pain and Marmion is dragged
out of it wounded, but his fiery spirit unsubdued. The
priest is near him with his consolations, and better still the
tender angelic ministries of a wronged but forgiving woman.</p>

<p>He had the rare facutly of compressing a whole life’s romance
in a few stanzas, as in “Lochinvar.”</p>

<p>Scott’s was not wholly an ideal world, nor his life a romance.
There was something very real and prosaic in it—something
also of the tragic. Not a few of the virtues of
his ideal heroes became prominent in his own life. After
his fame had been established, and nothing of earthly ambition
and popular applause remained unsatisfied, there came
upon him those sweeping financial disasters in which his
own fortunes and those of Constable his publisher went
down in wreck and ruin that seemed irretrievable. But with
a heroism unparalled in the history of literature, he girds
himself anew to cancel by his pen a debt that was colossal
in its magnitude. He was fifty-five years of age. He could
accept no compromise, but goes to work writing untiringly
until by sheer force and industry he succeeded in paying off
seventy thousand of the one hundred and seventeen thousand
pounds sterling which was the sum total of his debt,
but he achieved that tremendous feat at the expense of an
exhauseted brain and a paralyzed body. He perished in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
attempt to redeem his honor and good name. But the name
remains immortal and while Scottish hearts and Scottish
brains throb and beat, and tears and smiles be evoked as a
tribute to genius, the memory of Scott shall remain enshrined
on the deathless galaxy of fame.</p>

<p>Another of the great names imperishably with old Caledonia
is that of Robert Burns, the darling of the Scottish
muse, the pride and glory of his native land, and the idol
of the Scottish people. Poor unfortunate child of genius.
It is hard to read his brief history without being choked
with our sobs. Beginning life in the midst of the deepest
poverty, we are told that the miserable clay hovel in which
he first saw the light was partly wrecked by a January
tempest on the very night of his birth—sad forecast of the
brief, bitter, and stormy career which awaited him. At
sixteen years of age he tells us his life was “the cheerless
gloom of a hermit with the unceasing toil of a galley slave.”
After his father’s death the little paternal estae had to be
sold to satisfy creditors, and after three years “tossing and
whirling in the vortex of litigation” Robert and his brother
Gilbert succeeded in saving a trifle from the clutches of
the lawyears by stepping in as creditors for arrears of
wages. When they got to work again the poet received
the sum of seven pounds sterling (35 dollars) per annum.
Troubles multiplied upon him owing chiefly to his own indiscretions
until he says frankly “even in the hour of social
mirth, my gayety is the madness of an intoxicated criminal
under the hands of the executioner.”</p>

<p>But in the midst of his daily durgery and incessant toil
through summer heats and winter tempests, traveling
through the snow, toiling at the plow, thrashing his grain
with the “weary flingin tree,” attending market, he nevertheless
found time to chant some of the sweetest lyrics
ever penned. The outward conditions of his life were dark
and lowering, but these could not quench those movements
and ambitions of his inner man which flamed up like the
lurid flashes of volcanic fires, and threw over the dark
shadows of his destiny, a glory and a radiant heat which
no adversity could quench. He works like a slave, it is true,
but he must need pour in as occasion offered the pure and
holy oil of lofty aspirations gathered from nature’s ample
store, and a few well worn books, to feed the deathless
flame of song which had begun to burn upon the altar of
his heart. “He carried a book to study at spare moments
in the field and he wore out thus two copies of MacKenzie’s
Man of Feeling.” A suggestive hint, for with all his
misfortunes, and his sins, perhaps, no more tender heart
ever beat in human breast than that of Robert Burns. None
more loyal to friendship or more sensitive to generous love
and sympathy.</p>

<p>“There is sacrecely any earthly object” he says, “which
gives me more pleasure than to walk in the sheltered side
of a wood, or high plantation on a cloudy winter day, and
hear the stormy wind houling among the trees, and raving
over the plain. I listened to the birds and frequently<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
turned out of my path, lest I should disturb their little song
or frighten them to another station.”</p>

<p>Doubless his own misfortunes brought him into closer
relations of sympathetic feeling even with the poorest and
meanest things that were suddenly exposed to loss and pain,
as for instance in the inadvertent passage of his ploughshare
through a field mouse’s nest. Listen to his tender strain.</p>

<p>Perhaps the key note to Burns’ muse may be found in
the homage which he paid to woman. “He was alwoys in
love,” and he sang of love in strains as sweet as any mortal
minstrel ever made, but he was only a mortal after all: and
his illicit loves are the darkest blot on his name. But at
first this passion burned with a pure and guileless fervor;
and the sweetest lyric of his muse is the product of an
early attachment for Mary Campbell whom “death untimely
frost” snatched from his embrace. On the anniversary of
her death, he had stayed out all night in the barn, tossing
and tumbling till the dawn of day; and before the morning
star was quenched in the rising sun, he went into the house
and wrote:</p>

<p>No one has painted with such consummate skill, such tender
grace, and with such depth of coloring “the short and
simple annals of the poor” as Burns has done. He knew
by bitter experience the struggles of poverty, the grinding
toil needed to wring from an inhospitable climate, and unkindly
soil the meagre products which barely supported
life. His “Cottars’ Saturday Night” is a picture of peasant
life in Scotland unequalled for purity and beauty
by any production of genius, and is, we think, the crowning
triumph of his poetic skill. It is a finished production,
and his words flash upon our memory and imagination
those scnes of humble but honest poverty, pious worth
and modest joys, which relieve the monotonous burden of
the Scottish laborer’s daily toil. The week’s work is done,
and the poor toiler, gathering his few implements together,
wends his way across the moor to his humble home. His
gleeful little ones run to meet him. He is saluted by the
kindly smile of a contented wife. A bright fire throws a
genial glow over his poor but tidy home. The elder brains
drop in with the scanty pittances earned by domestic services
among their neighbors. Jenny, the pride of the family,
in the first bloom of womanhood, introduces with bashful
modesty, an honest lad worthy of her love and confidence.
The mother is glad that her brain is “respected like
the lave.”</p>

<p>“The father chats of horses, plows, and kye.” The humble,
hospitable board is spread, and the evening meal is
eaten with grateful thanks to God. Then “the big ha’ Bible”
is brought out, and the old song that fired to enthusiasm
the children of the Scottish covenant in their wanderings,
is sung, and “the saint, the father, and the husband
prays:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“That thus they all shall meet in future days,</div>
<div class="verse">There, ever bask in uncreated rays,</div>

<div class="verse indent1">In such society, yet still more dear;</div>
<div class="verse indent1">While circling time moves round in an eternal sphere.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>As he tells the touching and familiar story, a glow of honest
pride in his native land kindles in his breast, and he
places the chaplet of honor upon the brow of pious poverty.</p>

<p>Genius had few liberal patrons at that time; and the compensations
rendered to those who worshipped at the shrine
of the Muses, consisted in great part in patronizing invitations
to big dinners or in treats in the dram shops, where
poets paid for their etertainment by appearing as prodigies,
or by bartering the fine gold of their wit for draughts from
the Circean Cup of popular applause and brutal intoxication.</p>

<p>The convivial usages of the country were almost universal;
and Burns, with his genial nature and love of society,
easily fell a prey to the seductions of Bacchus. It was considered
an insult to hospitality to sit down to dinner in the
house of a friend and get up from the table sober.</p>

<p>It was a time when hosts were not solicitous about the
results of a revel or the comfort of guests, provided that
there was a plentiful supply of hot water and sugar to replenish
the punch bowl.</p>

<p>“But what will I do for beds for all these men?” said
Margaret, the Laird of Logan’s house keeper. “Keep the
kettle boiling Marg’et ma Wooman,” said the Laird, “and
they will a find beds for themselves” to be fechtin’ fou’ or
“greetin’ fow” was regarded as the normal condition of a
well dined gentleman.</p>

<p>It was too often alas at such shrines and amid such scenes
that poor Burns kindled the torch of his inspiration. He
drew from life when in his masterpiece of “Tam O’Shanter”
he pictured two drunken Cronies seeking respite from care
in foaming tankards of ale inn:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“Auld Ayr, wham ne’re a toon surpasses</div>
<div class="verse">For honest men and bonnie lassies.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>At Tam’s elbow sits Soute Johnie:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“His ancient droutly cronie:</div>
<div class="verse indent1">Tam lo’ed him like a verra brither;</div>
<div class="verse">They had been fou for week thegether.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>None knew better than Burns how ephemeral are the joys
of social drinking, and no one has ever produced such a
chain of similitudes to describe their fleeting sweetness.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“But pleasures are like poppies spread,</div>

<div class="verse">Or like the rainbow’s lovely form</div>
<div class="verse indent1">Evanishing amid the storm.</div>

<p>We know of nothing in literature that, in the same space,
contains so much of the homely, the horrible, and the grotesque,
as will be found in this poem. There is a sharp
Rembrandt-like minuteness in the details of this Scotch
Walpurgis night that produces terror on the reader mingled
with an irrisistible inclination to shriek with laughter. We
watch the hard drunken sot</p>

<p>Every turn in the road has its tragic associations. Here
a packman was smothered in the snow. Here hunters found
a murdered child. Here an old thorn tree near a well where
a woman hanged herself, etc. Till the adventurers are
crowned on his approaching the old Kirk at Alloway which
seems blazing to heaven.</p>

<p>We have stood in it, and really it looks a very innocent
ruin, nothing but four stone walls, roofles, with a niche at
one end where he old pulpit once stood. But in that neche
Burns put “Aul Nick” as a piper to whose music a rabble
rout of sheol are dancing “fast and furious.” Tammie urges
on his mare until he comes into the sheolish light which
gilds the ghastly scene, where the bones of murderers, the
garter that strangled a babe, the knife that lacerated the
throat of a father.</p>

<p>The devotee of Bacchees hastens to procure the protection
of the river Doon as witches dare not cross a running
stream, and is indebted to his good horse for his safety
although that is secured at the expense of her tail which she
leaves in the clutches of the “Carlin.”</p>

<p>Perhaps the songs of Burns have exercised a more universal
influence than his poems. They seize the heart and
hold it as by a spell of enchantment. Who knows not the
grand nation melody “Scots wha hae” and the familiar lyrics
“Auld Lang Syne,” “John Anderson, My Joe,” “Comin’
through the Rye,” etc. In most of his songs there is a strain
of sadness as indeed there is in most of the finest Scottish
lyrics other than those written by Burns.</p>

<p>The brightest gems of the Muse show the sparkle of tears
or utter the sad sigh which one hears in the moan of the
waves, or the wail of the midnight wind through a pine<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
forest. But the songs of Burns have a charm that enlist
the sympathy of the whole world. He voices the universal
experience. He is the high priest of nature. His words
give tone and character to the passion, the sorrows, the
pains and the joys of common people. He uses no artifice
to engage the interest of others. His genius was a well-spring
fresh and pure from the fountains of the heart, in
its first unstrained gushings: too soon, alas, to migle with
the defiling tributaries which a bitter experience of human
life brought to blend with the clearer stream. With his
great heart burning with a sense of wrong done him by
those who ought to have sheltered and befriended him,
mixed also with the bitter reflection that his own indiscretions
and sins had entailed suffering and shame upon himself
and upon those who were dearer to him than his own
life, he sinks into the dark tide of death as the age of 38
years; not, we trust, without a hope that the infinite Father
of mercy had heard the piteous appeal which he recorded
in these words.</p>

</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>He wrote his own epitaph, and it is an honest and sincere
confession, but if he had lived under more favorable auspices,
and had his environment been such as to assure that
the flame of his genius would have been nourished from the
altars of a purer and fitter companionship, he would probably
have penned a far different stanza than this which
fitly closes a dark and stormy career, not unrelieved by
many bright flashes of hope and gladness.</p>

<p>A spirit kindred to that of Robert Burns and one whose
fame shall never perish, or be dimmed while “Annie Laurie”
is sung—and where is it not sung? It is that of Robert
Tannahill, a poor Paisley weaver. We have stood on the
bridge which spans the canal near the city, and looked with
sorrowful interest into that pool in the corner, where, driven
by the demons of poverty and unappreciated talent, the disracted
author ended his brief life. He was a true poet. He
wrote many songs that the world will not willingly let die.
One of the stanzas is peculiarly fine in its delicacy and tenderness:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“Towering o’er the Newton woods</div>

</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>We would mention another bright name also a native
of this same town of Paisley. John Wilson—known better<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
by his pen name of “Christopher North” the author of
“Noctes Ambrosianae.” He rose from obscurity to great
honor and to the chair of moral philosophy in the University
of Ediuburgh. He was a giant in stature as well as in
mind, and one of the knightliest of men. No one who ever
met Wilson striding along the street, his long yellow hair
flowing over his shoulders, his blue eyes gleaming with merriment,
and glowing with an intelligence that comprehend
every department of knowledge, could ever forget him.</p>

<p>He may be fairly ranked with Scott and Burns in the
power he exercised in the later part of his life, in storming
the heart of the Scottish people—becoming at last their idol
and great literary representative. He was conemporary
with Thomas Brown whom he succeeded in the chair of
moral philosophy, and with Sir William Hamilton, who was
a candidate with him for the chair, but who, up to that time,
had not given to the public those proofs of that consumate
ability by which he was afterwards distinguished, and
which placed him in the foremost rank of the most eminent
European scholars.</p>

<p>Wilson once a poet, lecturer, statesman, orator, and novelist.
He was the intimate friend of Coleridge, Woodsworth,
and Southey. His poems of the “Isle of Palms” and the
“City of the Plague” are productions that gave him a worthy
place among those bright lights of song shed so brilliant a
luster over that age of great minds, and whose genuis has
bequeathed to all future time, the priceless legacy if immortal
harmonies and wealth of thought. He was with all
a very muscular Christian; “for on more than one occasion,
the singular spectacle was exhibited of a Scotch professor of
moral science taking off his coat in a public market place to
inflict personal chastisment on some ruffian whose obnoxious
proceedings has done outrage to his nicer sense of the fitness
of things.” He was, with Lockheart, one of the original
contributors to Blackwood’s Magazine, and helped
more than any other author to give that publication a popularity
that continues to this day.</p>

<p>It is said of Aytoun, Professor of Rhetoric and Belles Letters
in Ediuburgh University, when he was courting Wilson’s
daughter that he could not summon up courage to ask
her father to give his consent to their marriage, although
he knew how exalted a place he occupied in Wilson’s estimation.</p>

<p>Here stood the silver tongued Aytown, week after week,
trying to screw up his courage to ask the question that
filled his heart, but he could not do it. At length he said:
“Jessie, will you go and ask your father for me as I cannot?”
Jessie was soon beside her father and acquainted
him with how matters stood. “Puir Aytown,” said Wilson,
“I maun gie him his answer in writing.”</p>

<p>So saying he wrote a line without Jessie’s knowledge of
its purport, and pinning it on the back of her dress, sent
her off to Aytoun whom he well knew was just at that moment
fully appreciating the significance of the verb “to
wait.”</p>

<p>“What did he say, Jessie?” was the impatient interrogatory
of the loving professor. Jessie turned her back for
once upon her lover, and then he read the precious answer:
“With the Author’s compliments.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span></p>

<p>This same little town of Paisley is distinguished as the
birth place of another Wilson who is worthy of mention
here because he became famous as the great “American
ornithologist”—Alexander Wilson, born 1766. He began
his career also as a poet with a witty and felicitous production
called: “Watty and Meg.” That brings out with
marvelous fidelity some of the most humurous phases of
Scottish life and character. He came to America in 1794,
and after many and thrilling adventures, gave to the world
his great book on “American Birds” in seven quarto volumes.
George Ord and Charles Lucein Bonaparte completed
the work by issuing, after Wilson’s death, four volumes
more. It is a record of patient industry that helped to
put this land forward in the records of fame, and publish
to the world its marvelous resources.</p>

<p>We might give brief sketches of such. Dr. Thomas Guthrie,
the father of the ragged schools of Scotland. One short
story will illustrate how earnest was the Doctor in his efforts
to save the children from the dismal and fearful
depths of vice and crime and infamy.</p>

<p>One night at a public meeting, a reverend but very unsympathetic
speaker described the ragged school children
as rescals and vagabonds, the scum of the country. When
Guthrie’s time for speaking came, he arose with pale face
and quivering lips, seized a sheet of writing paper from the
table, and holding it up, said: “This was once the scum of
the country—once foul, wretched rags. In it, now white as
the snows of heaven, behold an emblem of the work our
ragged schools have achieved.”</p>

<p>And there was Sir David Brewster who could “scan with
more than an eagle’s eye, the mighty creations in the bosom
of space, and Hugh Miller, that huge geological hammer, inscribed
with Hebrew characters. It is a very noticeable
fact, that those minds that have most largely influenced
the thought and progress of civilized nations have not in
the main borrowed their light from an illustrious and
wealthy ancestry, but have risen from the ranks and been
found chiefly among the humble sons of poverty and toil.
The genius of Scotland has been nourished and developed
amid hard and hostile conditions. It has grown strong and
rooted itself deeply amid tempests and storms! not amid the
soft and voluptuous ease of effeminate luxury. It has given
to the world the brightest trophies of sciences, philosophy,
oratory, and song. Its sons have been scattered among all
people; but as a rule they have commanded the respect and
enlisted the effections of all among whom their lot has been
cast. They have ever felt the force of that fine sentiment
expressed by the greatestk of their poets.</p>

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
